    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",

We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "### **K-NN**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied:\n",
    "- Recommendation engines (content based): E-commerce item recommendations based on the items you already put into the shopping cart   \n",
    "\n",
    "##### What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well? \n",
    "- It doesn't require any training nor a lot of data to perform well.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "- It tends to overfit the training data and it perform poorly if it has to predict new data that differs heavily from the train set\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "- It is a good starting point since we don't have that much samples for the number of features that are present in the data (45.000 samples for 14th dimension data). Its greater strong is its simplicity, as more complex models might require either less dimensions or more samples to perform well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **SVM**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\n",
    "- Any binary classification problem is well suited for a SVM, especially those in which a lot of data is available and the classes are not unbalanced. A typical example would be as a decision support system for a bank in order to give credit to a customer or detecting cancer in a radiography.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well? \n",
    "- It works well with non-structured data like text, video or images. It has normally better accuracy than simpler models like regression given that there is enough data. Thanks to the kernel, it can be addapted to different data distribution therefore its very flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "- It requires heavy computational effort for training, therefore is not suitable for being trained in light devices such as raspberry/arduino. The main problem therefore in my opinion is the difficulty to explain the results of the prediction to business users since the method is not intuitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "- The relative high number of dimensions shouldn't be a problem for a SVM. Also the training time is not a problem since we don't need to train or to make predictions in real time. It is a step forward in complexity from models like regression or KNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Random Forests**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\n",
    "- I've used random forests in order to predict if a product manufactured in a production line is going to have quality issues or not. Any binary or multi-class clasification problem is well suited for a Random Forest.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well? \n",
    "- It is as accurate as SVM or ANN and it has the main advantage over them in its explicability. It is possible to track the explanation of every prediction in an intuitive way and it is also much easier to explain to business users than other more mathematically complex models. A nice side effect is that it can rank variables according to their importance to the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "- It requires significant time both to train and to predict, therefore is not well suited for scenarios in which real time predictions are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "- The main advantage could be the prevention of overfitting the training test because of the Random Forest being an ensemble method. Also the training time is not a problem since we don't need to train or to make predictions in real time. \n",

    "Everybody here loves democracy, right?. We know that sometimes an important decission made by a single person, no matter how wise he/she is, can be affected by its own prejudes and therefore be biased. We try to compensate it by taking important decissions by the voting of several informed persons.   \n",

    "The model that we have chosen rely in this principle. Instead of training a highly complex single model and relay solely on its predictions, we are going to create a number of simpler models (trees) which then will decide their prediction individualy and then vote on the option that they believe right. Those trees will randomly pick some of the variables of our data (age, employ, etc.) and generate if-else rules using them for predicting if a individual makes more or less than 50k a year. We will then evaluate how well those random trees perform in the prediction and we will keep the ones that makes better predictions (probably because they picked the more relevant variables). \n",

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
